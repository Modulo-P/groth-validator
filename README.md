# ZK-SNARK proof verification in Plutus

A Plutus implementation of the Groth16 ZKP-verification algorithm.

## Preliminaries

Using [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs), the _setup_ and _proof_ parts of the Groth16 protocol generate the files:

- `verification.json`
- `proof.json`
- `public.json`

## Testing instructions

We assume that you have cloned [Plutus-Apps](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps) and have [Nix](https://nixos.org/) installed and configured with the proper [substituters](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/tree/v1.0.0#iohk-binary-cache). At the `Plutus-Apps` directory, execute

```shell
git checkout v1.2.0
nix develop
```

After allowing enough time for the nix-shell to start, go to the directory where you cloned this repo and then to `./onchain/`. Then execute

```shell
cabal repl
```

The REPL should open in module `Test_BLS6_6`.

### ZK-proof verification using the BLS6_6</sub> elliptic curve

Inside the REPL, execute:

```shell
testValidator1
```

### ZK-proof verification using the BN128 elliptic curve

Change to module `Test`:

```shell
:m Test
```

To test the validator you need to provide the _snarkjs_ output files:

```shell
testValidator2 "pathTo/verification.json" "pathTo/proof.json" "pathTo/public.json"
```

You can find sample _snarkjs_ output files in directory `snarkjs` .

## Structure of the project (onchain code)

The onchain verification code is contained in the following files in directory `src`:

- `Params.hs` : global parameters associated with elliptic curve **BN128.**
- `ParseDatum.hs` : utility code for parsing the json files produced by _snarkjs._
- `ZKPVerification.hs` : implementation of the verification part of the Groth16 protocol and associated Plutus validator.
- `Test.hs` : allows convenient testing of the validator in the REPL.

Additionally, directory `src/BLS6_6` provides:

- `Params_BLS6_6` : global parameters associated with elliptic curve **BLS6_6</sub>**.
- `ZKPPVerification_BLS6_6` : identical to `ZKPVerification.hs` except that imports BLS6_6</sub> parameters.
- `Test_BLS6_6` : allows convenient testing of the validator in the REPL.

## Notes

- Directory `snarkjs` contains output files that can be used to test the validator using the BN128 elliptic curve.

  - files in `snarkjs/test00` were obtained implementing in snarkjs the _3-factorization problem_ described in [1].
  - files in `snarkjs/test01`, `snarkjs/test02` and `snarkjs/test03` correspond to outputs generated by our ZK-Mastermind game.

- Elliptic curve `BLS6_6` is described in detail in [1]. Datum in file `Test_BLS6_6.hs` was obtained from the ZK-SNARK setup and proof associated with the _3-factorization problem_ as explained in [1].
